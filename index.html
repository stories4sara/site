				<h1>Sara Kate Mason</h1>
				<p class="hero-paragraph">
					Sara Kate was born September 6, 2014. She was 8 weeks premature, and had complex congenital heart defects (CHDs) that were too severe to overcome. Sara lived 5 days, and passed away on September 11, 2014. Sara's life inspired so many of us! In her honor, we'd like to share our love of children's books and support local libraries with Stories4Sara.

					<h2>Donate a Book</h2>
					<p>The 2016 Stories4Sara book drive will benefit the Lovell Wyoming Library, Sara's local small-town library. We have teamed up with the Library to create a <a id="pink-link" href="https://amzn.com/w/VNEM1S42VKG3">wishlist</a> of needed books that will bless the lives of families in the Masons' community. All books purchased through this list will be donated to the Lovell Library in memory of Sara Kate Mason with a label placed inside. Please feel free to contact your own local library and donate there if you wish.</p>

					<h2>Raise Awareness</h2>
					<p>A Congenital Heart Defect (or CHD) means an abnormality of the heart that is present at birth. In general, there is no known cause or cure for heart defects. Congenital Heart Defects are the most common type of birth defect, affecting nearly 1 out of every 100 children born in the U.S. and across the world, and are the leading cause of birth-defect related deaths. Some CHD's are minor, but approximately 50% will require an invasive procedure (such as open heart surgery). CHD Awareness is critical to advancements in the medical field. As we all become aware of the realities of CHD's, more research will be funded, and more lives will be saved. Lives like our sweet Sara's.</p>
